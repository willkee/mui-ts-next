		"I am a graduate of a software engineering bootcamp from App Academy. This has been an incredible journey in which I have been inspired and challenged like never before, in a 1000+ hour curriculum over 24 weeks and with an acceptance rate of less than 5%. The 6 months in this program have only made me more passionate about building applications out of code or solving problems using technologies such as JavaScript, ReactJS/Redux, Express.js, and Python to name a few.",
		"I have built four full-stack applications, both independently and with a team of three other software engineers which have challenged me to use best Git workflow practices and utilizing separate branches and pull requests through GitHub. My last solo capstone project was a camping-themed lightweight clone of Airbnb. This project consisted of two full CRUD features, an embedded map through Google Maps API, a file upload system leveraging use of Amazon Web Services (AWS), and a wealth of error validations through Express Validators all to make for a better user experience, completed independently within the span of two weeks.",
		"Since then, I've worked at Etana Custody as a Frontend Developer where I had an amazing opportunity to learn and grow through a good amount of design and development freedom. I designed an internal service using technologies such as React.js, Redux, JavaScript, Material UI, AWS Cognito and AWS Amplify.",
		"I hope to bring my passion of coding and learning into my next journey after Etana Custody to work with a forward-thinking and innovative company in an ever-growing industry.",
